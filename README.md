#Security tool:
---------------
A DevOps security tool security tool is designed to integrate security practices into the DevOps lifecycle, ensuring that security is embedded throughout the development, deployment, and operations processes.
These tools aim to automate and streamline security tasks to support continuous integration and continuous delivery (CI/CD) pipelines. Key functions of DevOps security tools include:
 1. Vulnerability Scanning: Identifying security vulnerabilities in code, dependencies, and configurations.
 2. Static Application Security Testing (SAST): Analyzing source code or binaries for security flaws without executing the program.
3. Dynamic Application Security Testing (DAST): Testing running applications for vulnerabilities that can be exploited in real-time.
4. Security Configuration Management: Ensuring that infrastructure and applications are configured securely.
5. Compliance Monitoring: Checking adherence to security policies and standards.
6. Incident Response: Detecting and responding to security incidents in real time.
These tools help integrate security seamlessly into the DevOps workflow, allowing for early detection and remediation of security issues, thus reducing risk and improving overall security posture.
